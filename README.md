# 🧠 OS Simulator Suite

A **React-based frontend simulation project** demonstrating essential **Operating System (OS)** concepts through visual and interactive modules. Designed to make learning OS concepts engaging and intuitive, this project includes simulations for memory management, CPU scheduling, inter-process communication, and more.

> 💡 Built with **React**, **HTML**, and **CSS** — no backend required.



## 🧩 Features & Simulations

- 🧮 **Memory Management Simulation**  
  Visualize memory blocks, fragmentation, and allocation strategies.

- 🔁 **Page Replacement Algorithms**  
  Simulate FIFO, LRU, and other replacement strategies with step-by-step visuals.

- 👩‍🍳 **Dining Philosophers Problem**  
  See how resource locking and deadlocks play out in real time.

- ⚙️ **Producer-Consumer Problem**  
  Understand buffer management and synchronization with animated data flow.

- 📄 **Page Allocation (FIFO)**  
  Learn about page replacement using First-In-First-Out techniques.

- 📂 **File Table Management**  
  View how file tables track metadata and access within an OS.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
